# infinite-scroll

<h3>https://shawshanck.github.io/infinite-scroll/</h3>

This project is a template that uses API to fetch images from (https://unsplash.com/). It also uses JavaScript functions to load images infinitely by scrolling down the mouse.

* Show unlimited images from API without reloading the page and just by scrolling down the mouse.
* Responsive Layout.
* Smooth Loading.

Skills that I learned by doing this project:

* HTML: Basic HTML to stablish a standalone page. Creating a loader element and a container for images.
* CSS: Responsive layout, and costumizing HTML elements.
* JavaScript: Using API to fetch images. Creating a "Helper Function to Set Attributes on DOM Elements". Creating "Elements for Links & Photos". Creating a function to load more images by scrolling down near to the buttom of the page and some many functions related to loading/showing images.

> **Note**: You should sign up on https://unsplash.com/ and get your own API key and replace it on line 15 of script.js with 'YOUR-API-KEY'
